# Computer Programming: Visual Basic Projects

This repository contains applications developed in **Visual Basic** for the **Computer Programming** (Programarea Calculatoarelor) course. These projects are part of the academic curriculum for the **Economic Informatics** (Informatică Economică) specialization at the **University of Craiova**.

The collection focuses on building graphical user interfaces (GUI) and implementing logic for economic data processing.

## 📂 Project Overview

These assignments cover the fundamental pillars of event-driven programming:
* **User Interface Design**: Creating interactive forms using standard .NET controls (Buttons, TextBoxes, Labels).
* **Economic Logic**: Implementing algorithms for financial calculations, data validation, and business rules.
* **Control Structures**: Using loops, conditional statements, and subroutines to manage program flow.
* **Data Management**: Basic handling of variables, arrays, and user input within a GUI environment.

## 🚀 How to Run

To explore and run these projects, you will need **Microsoft Visual Studio**:

1. **Clone/Download**: Download the project folder to your local machine.
2. **Open**: Locate the `.sln` (Solution) or `.vbproj` (Project) file and open it with Visual Studio.
3. **Run**: Press `F5` (or the **Start** button) to compile and launch the application.
